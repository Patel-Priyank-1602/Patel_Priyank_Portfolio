                    <div class="content">
                        <p><b>What it is:</b> Each state in India may have its own Rent Control Act, which regulates the relationship between landlords and tenants. The Act aims to provide protections to tenants from eviction without proper grounds and establishes the rights of tenants regarding rent increases, maintenance, and security deposits.</p>
                        <p>The Act often prevents landlords from evicting tenants without sufficient reason, such as failure to pay rent or illegal activities.</p>

                        <p><b>Right to Fair Rent:</b> Tenants are entitled to pay rent that is considered reasonable and cannot be arbitrarily increased by the landlord without following legal procedures.</p>

                        <p><b>Security Deposit:</b> Most rental agreements require tenants to pay a security deposit, which is refundable at the end of the lease term, subject to the condition of the property.</p>

                        <p><b>Grounds for Eviction:</b> Landlords can only evict tenants based on specific grounds, such as non-payment of rent, subletting without permission, or the need to use the property for personal reasons. Eviction requires a court order in most cases.</p>
                        <p>The eviction process is usually a lengthy legal process, providing tenants with time to contest it.</p>
