                            diesel) attract a 28% GST plus additional cess, which can range from 1% to 22% based on the

                    <summary>Road Tax</summary>
                    <p>Road Tax in Gujarat is levied based on the value of the vehicle, its age, and its engine
                        capacity. There are two types of road tax in Gujarat:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>One-time road tax:</strong> Paid at the time of vehicle registration and is valid
                            for a set number of years. The tax depends on the vehicle's cost and engine capacity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Annual road tax:</strong> Paid yearly for the continued use of the vehicle on public
                            roads. The tax is recalculated based on the vehicle's depreciation and value.</li>

                    <summary>Green Tax</summary>
                    <p>In Gujarat, a green tax is applicable to older vehicles (usually 15 years or older). This tax
                        aims to encourage the scrapping of older, high-polluting vehicles. The green tax is a one-time
                        fee that can vary based on the type of vehicle and its emissions.</p>

                    <summary>Insurance Tax</summary>
                    <p>Motor insurance is mandatory in Gujarat. While it is not a direct tax, the insurance premium is
                        subject to GST at a rate of 18%. The premium must be paid to keep the vehicle legally insured
                        and compliant with the law.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Cess: A percentage of the vehicle's price based on its engine size and type. Luxury vehicles
                            may have higher cess charges.</li>
                        <li>State-specific taxes: Gujarat may impose additional taxes on premium vehicles, especially if
                            they exceed a certain price threshold.</li>

                    <p>If you're driving on highways in Gujarat, you will need to pay toll charges. These charges are
                        based on the type of vehicle, distance traveled, and specific toll plazas. Toll rates may vary

                        <p><b>What it is:</b> After deducting TDS, the bank will provide a TDS certificate (Form 16A),
                            which shows the TDS amount deducted and deposited with the government.</p>
                        <p>The TDS certificate can be used to claim the deducted tax while filing income tax returns.
