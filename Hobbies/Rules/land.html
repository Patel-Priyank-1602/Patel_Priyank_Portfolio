                <p>
                    In India, <b>NA (Non-Agricultural)</b> land refers to land that is designated for purposes other
                    than agricultural activities. This land can be used for industrial, commercial, residential, or
                    other non-farming purposes. The rules and regulations for converting agricultural land to NA land
                    are governed by the respective state laws, as land ownership and usage fall under state
                    jurisdiction.

                                or commercial), it cannot be used for agriculture anymore.</li>
                            <li><b>Government Policies:</b> NA land conversion is often subject to policies aimed at
                                controlling urban sprawl and preserving agricultural land.</li>
                            <li><b>Time and Cost:</b> The conversion process can be time-consuming and costly due to the
                                paperwork and fees involved.</li>
